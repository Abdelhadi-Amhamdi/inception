images 
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
Often, an image is based on another image.

Containers
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.
